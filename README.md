# PoEResources
This provides small help for developers looking for specific things, such as full list of item names, cards, currencies, API, etc.


### What was used
The Official PoE API for the items: [https://www.pathofexile.com/api/trade/data/items](https://www.pathofexile.com/api/trade/data/items)
I went through and extracted all the names/text where it was relevant. (on some it's better to use name on some text)

## Names Included in the JSONs
1. Accessories
2. Armour
3. Cards
4. Currency
5. Flasks
6. Gems
7. Jewels
8. Maps
9. Weapons
10. Leaguestones
11. Prophecies
12. Itemised Monsters
13. Heist Items
14. Heist Blueprints
